## Getting your sales team ready for a challenging year ahead 

Looking forward to 2023, is your sales team ready to face expense restraints, difficulty meeting with decision-makers, more competitive business and pricing pressures?

If your salespeople have taken a more transaction approach in the past, pushing proposals at prospects who don't fit your business and presenting too early without providing any real value to change, please keep reading.

Their probably getting "ghosted" or a non-commitment to proceed. "No decision" is a salesperson's biggest threat, and some have been waiting for years to find out as they're too worried to upset the prospect with tough questions like, "would you like to proceed"?

Objective Management Groups statistics tell us that of salespeople in the bottom 25% (weakest) sales percentile, 82% of them have this weakness. Compare this to the top 5% (elite), where only 18% "need to be liked" as a strength. If you need to be liked, this can cause a salesperson to avoid asking difficult questions in case they upset their prospect or client.

> Asking difficult questions uncovers compelling reasons for change, budget awareness, timelines and priorities so that you're not just pitching what you do but what you do and how it helps achieve their desired outcomes.
