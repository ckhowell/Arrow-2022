#### Turning training into revenue.

Imagine finally landing those dream accounts. The ones you‚Äôve always wanted but never quite had the confidence, skill, or process to win. That‚Äôs exactly what our new sales training programs are designed to help you achieve.

At Arrow Executive Sales, we don‚Äôt just ‚Äútick the training box‚Äù. We focus on results you can measure - more meetings with decision-makers, more compelling conversations and more closed deals.

We‚Äôve designed our courses to bridge the most common gaps in sales capability, helping both sales professionals and leaders build the confidence and skill to consistently win new business.

### Why Typical Training Fails and How We Fix It

Research shows 84% of traditional training is forgotten within 90 days if it‚Äôs not applied, reinforced, and coached. We do things differently with shorter, high-impact sessions, practical application on live opportunities and targeted 1:1 coaching to lock in new behaviours.

Like athletes, salespeople need to train the right way. Even a 20‚Äì30% improvement can be a game-changer for hitting targets, earning incentives and enjoying your craft.

### The Return On Investment (ROI) You Can Bank On

Sales training should be an investment that pays for itself. We‚Äôll help you:

- Get in front of decision-makers faster.
- Create urgency so opportunities don‚Äôt stall.
- Craft compelling reasons for clients to choose you over the competition.
- Build trust early so you‚Äôre seen as a strategic partner, not just another supplier.

And it all starts with uncovering your Sales DNA.

### Step One: Diagnose Before We Prescribe

Before we recommend training, we run a Sales DNA Evaluation. A detailed 38-page analysis of mindset, tactical skills across 21 core sales competencies. You‚Äôll see exactly how you compare to over 2.8 million salespeople worldwide and where your biggest growth opportunities are.

Valued at $1,195 + GST, this process ensures your training is targeted for maximum impact. We refer this as ‚Äúdiagnose before prescribing‚Äù.

### Step Two: Choose Your Impact Courses

Once we‚Äôve reviewed your Sales DNA results, you can select from six high-impact courses:

#### Half day courses:

1. **Sales Mindset ‚Äì Uncover Hidden Barriers**  
   Build resilience, motivation and self-awareness so you can push through challenges and sell without roadblocks.

2. **Relationship Building ‚Äì Accelerate Trust, Win Faster**  
   Win trust early, secure meetings with decision-makers and earn client loyalty that follows you wherever you go.

3. **Selling Value ‚Äì Stop Competing on Price**  
   Protect margin by selling unique value and positioning your solution as the only logical choice.

Half day course format is designed for busy professionals:

- 3 x 60-minute virtual group sessions (Weekly)
- 1 x 30-minute 1:1 coaching session with Jason Howes

#### Full day course format to reinforce and embed new learning.

4. **Consultative Selling ‚Äì Ask, Listen and Win**

5. **Prospecting ‚Äì Build a Pipeline That Closes**  
   Target the right accounts, warm up cold calls and maintain a steady flow of qualified opportunities. We‚Äôre sharing our process, that works!

6. **Closing ‚Äì Win More, Win Smarter**  
   Spot decision points, remove roadblocks and close naturally by following a milestone-driven process. This is done in conjunction with other courses, will seriously impact your growth.

You‚Äôll apply new techniques in real conversations, with coaching to refine your approach.

### Step Three: Measure, Adjust, Win

80% of the way through, we revisit your Sales DNA (complimentary consider changing to ‚Äì part of our detailed process) to review your progress. You‚Äôll compare your starting percentile to now, identify what‚Äôs working and fine-tune for even better results. Our goal is to get you into the top 20% of sales performers.
