# Most sales and business leaders are frustrated with how difficult it is to hire a quality sales professional right now, let alone find an actual sales unicorn.

I can confess that we've hired a handful in the last few years, but most have come from outside of the required industry where you're not even looking and still need some professional onboarding assistance.

Some companies are going without team members, while others are taking the best candidate they can find as they are desperate to get people on the ground.

The cost of going with your gut feeling or hiring just because of industry experience or because you get along with them quickly doesn't mean they'll perform to your expectations.

Maybe it's time to invest more into your systems, processes and onboarding to provide more opportunities for your candidate to succeed.

Investing in professional coaching to support their onboarding process is ten times more economical than not reaching probation and starting again.

What about the impact on your business and customers?
