> Self-limiting beliefs in salespeople can sabotage sales success; they are the hidden roadblocks many of us don't even know exist. A top 3 self-limiting belief from OMG stats that affects 80% of salespeople is... "prospects that think it over will eventually buy from me". â†“ðŸ’£

As we unpack this one, I think back to my old days selling and managing national sales teams.

Many salespeople think that persistence will pay off eventually, and sometimes it does, mainly if a situation like product shortages occur, the prospect is desperate and needs to fix the problem.

But in many cases, we see salespeople call on prospects for years without any success. Why? Let's discuss this in more detail?

Maybe they aren't the right type of client in the first place? How much time could they have saved if they'd worked this out years ago?

That's why it's so important to have your ICP (Ideal Client Profile); you need to point your arrow towards the target to start.

The salesperson might be comfortable just seeing prospects on their territory runs, and it fills in the call sheet without much stress?

Many salespeople are not comfortable asking difficult questions, as they want the prospect to like them. For many, it's more important than pushing for some movement or commitment. Sound familiar?

By following a milestone centric sales process, you will qualify early on your best targets. You'll invest time in the right areas and progress these opportunities with tremendous sales success through your pipeline.

To cut a long story short, can your salespeople present at request a targeted list of prospects?

And ones that are in their pipeline is there a commitment for the next step?

If not, then it's highly possible that their pipeline isn't full of the right prospects, ones that are closable, or they haven't uncovered compelling reasons for change. Or all of the above!

Improving in these areas can make a significant impact on sales performance, so why let it continue? Invest in your team. Our coaching, systems and processes pay for themselves as our priority is to improve your teams win rates.
