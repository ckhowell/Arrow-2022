## How much do you focus on retaining and expanding existing customers vs acquiring new ones? 

Customers are much more likely to let go of suppliers when they have lost trust in their relationship; in particular, they may feel hard done by over recent years with the supply and service they received.

They will likely continue to invest and expand their relationship with your competitor, resulting in your salesperson defaulting to a price reduction to keep their business.

One of the most critical things any sales team can do right now is to take the time to identify which existing clients have the highest potential to grow with your company.
