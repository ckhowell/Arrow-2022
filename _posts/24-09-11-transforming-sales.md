### In an increasingly competitive business landscape, the traditional methods of recruitment and sales training are proving insufficient. Enter Arrow Executive Sales, an Australian company that has distinguished itself by blending science and technology with strategic analysis and sales enablement to redefine what it means to cultivate a high-performing sales team.

Jason Howes, Owner and Managing Director of Arrow, is a veteran of the sales industry with over three decades of experience. His journey from a novice salesperson in 1989 to the helm of Arrow has been marked by a relentless pursuit of innovation and excellence. This drive is evident in Arrow’s unique approach to recruitment and training. Jason explained,
“having walked in the shoes of the salesperson, and sales leader gives me a great understanding of what challenges they face. I actively sell every single day, so I know what it’s like.”

On average, companies invest between 2% and 5% of payroll on sales training. For example, if you pay your salespeople an annual base salary of $100,000, you should invest between $2,000 and $5,000 in yearly sales training per employee. Investing in sales training should be looked at as a ROI (return on investment), not a cost. Howes question to companies is “what if your $5,000 investment made you $20,000 or $50,000, let alone raised the bar within your company?” Arrow Executive Sales, which has been operational for five and a half years, stands out by using sophisticated tools and technologies that are globally recognized for their efficacy. “The old school methods will only take a salesperson so far,” Howes notes.

In an industry like timber and forest products, where selling new products presents unique challenges, Arrow’s approach offers a significant competitive edge.
