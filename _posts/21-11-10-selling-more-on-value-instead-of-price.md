> A salesperson can tend to discount too quickly if that's their way of purchasing. As a sales professional, you need to consider that every individual has a different spending mentality, not mirror how "YOU BUY" with how "YOU SELL".

Think about this before offering a discount and go back to selling more on value instead of just price.

Right now, with so many price increases to your business, this is the best time to truly understand the actual cost and value you provide to your clients.

### How else can you help them solve their problems?
In many cases, we have opportunities to increase sales right in front of us with our existing clients.

Give them the time and hearing they deserve. If you listen closely and use consultative selling techniques, you will understand their pain points and sell your solutions based on value.

### How are your salespeople dealing with the changing dynamics today?

Are they effectively still developing new business?

Can they sell more on value, or are they struggling to understand why products have increased? Maybe they can't see the value in it? This is a red flag as sometimes it's easier to push you back on price rather than the customer.
