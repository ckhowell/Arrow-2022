### Simply put, there is a significant shortage of sales talent across most industries, and addressing this issue is crucial. Currently, the average tenure of a salesperson is only 17 months, indicating a concerning trend of decreasing retention rates each year.

Here are five key areas hindering the new generation from entering sales or achieving success:

1. **Perception of Sales Career:** Sales is often viewed as something other than an attractive career option, despite the potential perks and financial rewards it offers. To attract and retain talent, we need to adopt a more data-driven approach in selecting individuals suited for sales based on commitment, motivation factors, and core values. Unfortunately, many of us were moved into the role because it was an easy and cheap solution. 

2. **Investing in Recruitment:** Companies must recognize the value of investing in recruitment strategies and technology that support effective hiring practices. Creating a supportive and growth-oriented culture is essential to attract top talent and ensure successful onboarding. (50% of hires fail; this has to improve) 

3. **Importance of Sales Training:** Effective sales training and coaching are vital for developing and retaining salespeople. Continuous reinforcement and monitoring of training programs are necessary to ensure long-term success. This must be built into your sales systems, process and tech to ensure efficiency. 

4. **Sales Systems and Processes:** Many companies need more streamlined sales systems and processes, relying heavily on manual methods. Implementing structured onboarding programs and providing mentorship can significantly enhance the onboarding experience and boost client satisfaction. Most of us need to get handed over better, so we have to start over again to frustrate our clients even more. 

5. **Guidance for Younger Generation:** It is crucial to provide direction and support to the younger generation of sales professionals. Allocating time for structured one-on-one sessions, embracing technology, and actively listening to their needs are key to fostering their growth and success.

Addressing these key areas is essential to overcome sales talent shortages and empower the new generation of sales professionals for success.
