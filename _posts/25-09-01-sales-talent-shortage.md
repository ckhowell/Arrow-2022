# Breaking the Sales Talent Shortage

## A Blueprint for CEOs and Business Owners

**By Jason Howes**

Building an unstoppable business starts with having the right people in the right roles. Yet the building industry is currently facing a critical shortage of skilled sales talent, presenting major roadblocks to growth.

### The Root Cause

Many salespeople are thrown into the deep end without proper training, coaching or tools to measure success. Expected to turn a company's performance around, most struggle to stay afloat and fall short of expectations. Without the right support, very few can thrive in such challenging conditions.

CEOs and business owners, it's time to change this. Just as any building needs a solid foundation, a high-performing sales team needs the right training, structure and mentorship to succeed.

### Why Salespeople are Struggling

Imagine being asked to hit ambitious targets without a roadmap. It's no surprise that many sales professionals feel disoriented and underappreciated. Without structured training and direction, high turnover and underperformance are inevitable—costly problems for any business.

The issue runs deeper. Many talented sales professionals are hired for roles that don't align with their strengths or are stuck in positions where they can't grow. It's like placing a skilled builder in the wrong trade—passionate but unable to deliver their best. Without clarity or the right support, they disengage, wasting their potential. It's time to provide the right structure, training and guidance so they can thrive and contribute to your business's success.

### The Real Cost of Misalignment

When your sales team lacks direction and purpose, it's like revving the engine of a high-performance car—tyres spinning, smoke pouring out, but you're going nowhere fast. You've got all the power, but without the right alignment and training, you're just burning rubber. The real cost? Lost deals, missed revenue, and a clouded path ahead—leaving disillusioned employees to kick up the dust as they walk out the door.

We've all seen it: the talented sales rep relegated to an inside role, itching to be out on the road, or the junior executive who could be a top performer with the right training and mentorship. Instead, they're stuck spinning their wheels and eventually move on to an industry that's investing where you're not. If you're not developing your people, you're losing them.

### The Path to Sales Success

So, what's the solution to the talent shortage? The answer lies in creating a structured sales trajectory program that takes ambitious professionals from inside sales roles to high-performing Business Development Managers in 12 to 18 months. It's about developing a clear, strategic path for growth that aligns individual potential with business needs.

Here's how we do it at Arrow Executive Sales:

## 1. EVALUATE: Assess Sales Potential

Building a high-performing sales team isn't about placing people based on gut feel. It starts with understanding who's on board, what drives them, and where their strengths lie. Leveraging a global technology platform, we go beyond CVs and KPIs to uncover hidden talent and "diamonds in the rough." Our evaluations focus on mindset, sales ability and coachability to ensure every team member is positioned for maximum success in client-facing or inside sales roles.

## 2. ATTRACT: Recruit Top Talent

If your team is missing the right talent or you're short-staffed, we can help you find the ideal fit. Specialising in recruiting sales hunters who drive business growth, we leverage advanced recruitment AI and our extensive industry network to pinpoint top performers—cutting your time-to-hire by up to 85%.

## 3. INCENTIVISE: Create a Performance Framework

To attract and retain top sales talent, it's crucial to balance competitive base salaries with performance-based incentives. Structuring compensation around achievements and aligning payouts with performance helps create a driven, results-oriented team. Our solution offers clear dashboards and seamless CRM integration, giving sales teams full visibility into how their efforts impact their earnings—building trust and boosting motivation to hit targets.

## 4. ACCELERATE: Develop Sales Skills

Once you know who's got the potential, it's time to provide them with the tools and training that align with your business priorities. Our comprehensive 12-month program breaks down best practices into bite-sized, actionable lessons. It's hands-on experience, targeted coaching and strategic learning designed to build skills, boost confidence and accelerate growth.

### Real Business Growth Begins with People

The shortage of skilled sales talent is real, but it can be overcome. Industry leaders need to take a proactive approach by investing in structured training, aligning talent with the right roles, and providing the tools and coaching needed for growth. Partnering with an industry veteran passionate about winning new business can make all the difference.
