Sales effectiveness and sales optimism creates opportunity for improvement in sales. Make sure you maximise Friday afternoons, as most clients don't want to see salespeople anyway.

It's the perfect time to catch up, complete outstanding tasks, log your CRM calls for the upcoming week, update your pipeline and have a 1:1 with your sales manager to ensure you are both working in alignment. 

> Protect your selling time, time block for prospecting and new business development and be ready to sell on Monday. 

This is much better to start than simply going into the office Monday morning without a plan and messing with non-productive tasks, like customer service, then getting to lunch and going "I won't go out today". Not a good start to your week! 

You'll be much more present for your clients by having a positive start for the week, and you will become so much more organised and have a strong sales mindset for success. 

Try it out this week.
