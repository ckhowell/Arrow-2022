We also discussed in more detail the future of attracting our younger generation into the estimators/detailers career path. A new title of Timber Systems Designer creates a more precise language to attract a larger candidate pool with a bit more style. It needs to be clarified with all the similar job titles in our industry. What are your thoughts?

> "Work perks" are essential in today's market, things like what does our company offer that makes others want to work for us? It could be a "hybrid" WFH role, remote with different hours that suit families, or a 1/2 day off each month if you meet your KPIs.

Please get in touch with Kersten for additional information on the FTMA services, like job descriptions, job adverts and short courses.

If you know someone in your network who could be a good fit for our frame and truss industry, like a tradie who's had enough of working on the tools, please comment on this post.
