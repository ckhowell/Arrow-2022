feature-heading-1: Align with Ideal Client Profile
feature-txt-1: "Knowing and understanding your ideal client is essential before developing a milestone-centric sales process. It’s crucial to focus on having the right opportunities in the pipeline to avoid wasting time on leads that will never convert. <br /><br />
Defining an ideal client persona or ideal customer avatar helps you develop your brand messaging and increases the effectiveness of your sales and marketing efforts. The added bonus is reduced marketing cost, a shortened sales cycle and increased conversions.

feature-heading-2: The power of an effective CRM
feature-txt-2: "The importance of an effective CRM cannot be overstated. Many B2B companies have a CRM that’s outdated and, to put it bluntly, useless. Often  management chooses the cheapest CRM that’s hard to use and only report data. This approach holds you back from growing and being more effective plus you lose ownership of data. There is a better way.
